# Quest Verify Bot

Quest Verify Bot will ensure users that join your FiveM Discord Community change their nick name to match the format "CharacterName [SteamName]" with a manual approval system with buttons sent to staff in a staff channel




## FAQ

#### What is "staffchannel" in the config.json?

This determines the channel that staff use to accept or deny the verification request sent from the users wishing to verify!

#### What is "verfiedrole" in the config.json?

This will set the role the bot will give when the users verification request is accepted by staff

#### What is "color" in the config.json?

This sets the color of all the embeds the bot will send including the "Verify" button embed and the staff request embeds, this value has to be a color hex for example "#9aaae3"

#### Why am I getting permission errors?

You are likely receiving these errors because the bot does not have the permission to give roles or the role it is trying to give it above the bot itself thus it cannot give this role

I'm Zesty a snowboard instructor from Australia developing Discord Bots in my spare time between ski seasons... I am fully self taught thus the code will most likely look substandard to those who are professionals however it works and I suppose that's all that matters to most!
